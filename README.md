# Angular Tour Of Heroes

Official Angular 2 tutorial with minor corrections.

Instead of hero array list, which originally started with 11, 12, 13... it's corrected so that array will start with 1, 2, 3...  

Also, at first page where is top heroes are originally listed from number 2 (2th, 3th, 4th, 5th), is also corrected to display top heroes from number one (1st, 2th, 3th, 4th).  

There are few other css tweaks as well.
