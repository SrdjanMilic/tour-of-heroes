# Angular Tour Of Heroes

Official Angular 2 tutorial corrected:

Instead of hero array list, which by default starts with 11, 12, 13... it's corrected so that array will start with
1, 2, 3...

Also, at first page where top heroes are listed by default from number 2 (2th, 3th, 4th, 5th), is also corrected to
display top heroes from number one (1st, 2th, 3th, 4th).

There are few other code/design fixes as well.
